## 📊 Data Sources
The dashboard uses integrated datasets containing:
- EV stock and sales numbers  
- Powertrain classifications (BEV, PHEV, FCEV, etc.)  
- Charging infrastructure availability  
- Time-series metrics (2010–2035)  
- Regional classifications (Developed / Developing)  

Data can be replaced by modifying source tables in the BI tool.
